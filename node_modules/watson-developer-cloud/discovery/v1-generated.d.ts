     * Construct a DiscoveryV1 object.
     *
     * @param {Object} options - Options for the service.
     * @param {string} options.version - The API version date to use with the service, in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Whenever the API is changed in a backwards incompatible way, a new minor version of the API is released. The service uses the API version for the date you specify, or the most recent version before that date. Note that you should not programmatically specify the current date at runtime, in case the API has been updated since your application's release. Instead, specify a version date that is compatible with your application, and don't change it until your application is ready for a later version.
     * @param {string} [options.url] - The base url to use when contacting the service (e.g. 'https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api'). The base url may differ between Bluemix regions.
     * @param {string} [options.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
     * @param {string} [options.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
     * @param {string} [options.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
     * @param {string} [options.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
     * @param {string} [options.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
     * @param {boolean} [options.use_unauthenticated] - Set to `true` to avoid including an authorization header. This option may be useful for requests that are proxied.
     * @param {Object} [options.headers] - Default headers that shall be included with every request to the service.
     * @param {boolean} [options.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out] - Set to `true` to opt-out of data collection. By default, all IBM Watson services log requests and their results. Logging is done only to improve the services for future users. The logged data is not shared or made public. If you are concerned with protecting the privacy of users' personal information or otherwise do not want your requests to be logged, you can opt out of logging.

     * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
     * @param {string} params.environment_id - The ID of the environment.
     * @param {string} params.collection_id - The ID of the collection.
     * @param {string} [params.filter] - A cacheable query that excludes documents that don't mention the query content.
     * Filter searches are better for metadata-type searches and for assessing the concepts in the data set.
     * @param {string} [params.query] - A query search returns all documents in your data set with full enrichments and
     * full text, but with the most relevant documents listed first. Use a query search when you want to find the most
     * relevant search results. You cannot use **natural_language_query** and **query** at the same time.
     * @param {string} [params.natural_language_query] - A natural language query that returns relevant documents by
     * utilizing training data and natural language understanding. You cannot use **natural_language_query** and **query**
     * at the same time.
     * @param {boolean} [params.passages] - A passages query that returns the most relevant passages from the results.
     * @param {string} [params.aggregation] - An aggregation search that returns an exact answer by combining query search
     * with filters. Useful for applications to build lists, tables, and time series. For a full list of possible
     * aggregations, see the Query reference.
     * @param {number} [params.count] - Number of results to return. The maximum for the **count** and **offset** values
     * together in any one query is **10000**.
     * @param {string[]} [params.return_fields] - A comma-separated list of the portion of the document hierarchy to
     * return.
     * @param {number} [params.offset] - The number of query results to skip at the beginning. For example, if the total
     * number of results that are returned is 10 and the offset is 8, it returns the last two results. The maximum for the
     * **count** and **offset** values together in any one query is **10000**.
     * @param {string[]} [params.sort] - A comma-separated list of fields in the document to sort on. You can optionally
     * specify a sort direction by prefixing the field with `-` for descending or `+` for ascending. Ascending is the
     * default sort direction if no prefix is specified.
     * @param {boolean} [params.highlight] - When true, a highlight field is returned for each result which contains the
     * fields which match the query with `<em></em>` tags around the matching query terms.
     * @param {string[]} [params.passages_fields] - A comma-separated list of fields that passages are drawn from. If this
     * parameter not specified, then all top-level fields are included.
     * @param {number} [params.passages_count] - The maximum number of passages to return. The search returns fewer
     * passages if the requested total is not found.
     * @param {number} [params.passages_characters] - The approximate number of characters that any one passage will have.
     * @param {string} [params.deduplicate_field] - When specified, duplicate results based on the field specified are
     * removed from the returned results. Duplicate comparison is limited to the current query only, **offset** is not
     * considered. This parameter is currently Beta functionality.
     * @param {boolean} [params.similar] - When `true`, results are returned based on their similarity to the document IDs
     * specified in the **similar.document_ids** parameter.
     * @param {string[]} [params.similar_document_ids] - A comma-separated list of document IDs to find similar documents.
     *
     * **Tip:** Include the **natural_language_query** parameter to expand the scope of the document similarity search
     * with the natural language query. Other query parameters, such as **filter** and **query**, are subsequently applied
     * and reduce the scope.
     * @param {string[]} [params.similar_fields] - A comma-separated list of field names that are used as a basis for
     * comparison to identify similar documents. If not specified, the entire document is used for comparison.
